Learning goals:

- `while`\-loops

You will bring 4 Euros (`int`) to a fair. Then `while` you still have money, you will either:

1. look around (costs nothing): print _Yay!_
2. go in a ride (costs 1 Euro): print _Wheee!_

(any other choice can be ignored)

When out of money, print _Time to go home_

Example output:

```text
Money left: 4
Look around (1) or go in a ride (2)?
>2
Wheee!
Money left: 3
