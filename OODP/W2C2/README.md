Learning goals:

- return value from a method

Write a program with a method called `Pow2`. This method takes an `int` as a parameter, and it returns the square. So for example: _Pow2(5)_ should result in _25_ as _5 \* 5_ is _25_.

Note: your submission will be unit tested. In order for the unit test to be able to test your program, you should make your class `public`.
