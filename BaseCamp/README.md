# BaseCamp Assignments

These are the (Python) assignments that I have to do for my first year of computer science at the Rotterdam University
of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool Rotterdam).

### Folder Structure:

Arch -> Week -> Assignment/Problem

**Example:** `A1W3A2`

**Means:** Arch 1 -> Week 3 -> Assignment 2

or

**Example:** `A1W3P2`

**Means:** Arch 1 -> Week 3 -> Problem 2

Each assignment/problem folder contains the Python script and the assignment description to go along with it. (Written
in Markdown)

**Assignments are mandatory and problems are optional/extra.**
