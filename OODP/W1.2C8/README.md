Learning goals:

- generate **pseudo**random `int`egers

This is the same assignment as the previous one, except now we will pass 1 as a parameter to the `Random` object. So you instantiate the object like this: `Random(1)`. This means the outcomes will always be the same, so that it's easier to test your program.

Again simulate 10 six-sided die rolls and print them. The outcomes should always be like this:

```text
2
1
3
5
4
3
3
6
1
4
```
