Learning goals:

- `void` methods

Write a program that has a `class` (named `Program` for example). Within this class, create a `public static void Main` method. If there is a `Main` method, it will be the entry point of the program.

Then create a method called `PrintFullName`. Like the `Main` method, it is `public`, `static` and `void`. This method has two `string` parameters: `firstName` and `lastName`. It prints the full name, which is the first name and the last name, separated by a space.

From the `Main` method, call `PrintFullName` with "John" and "Doe". The output of this program should then be _John Doe_.

### Note

In this course (and in the exam!), if you are asked to write a method, make it `public` unless specified otherwise!
